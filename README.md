# Brexit_Simulator
Overview:
Brexit themed simulation along the lines of exploring the benefit of informational advantage in influencing negotiation outcomes. The basic ideas are not necessarily specific to Brexit but can be extrapolated to many different game theory or negotiating situations.
This is intended to be light hearted but at the same time interesting. 
The main aim of the simulation is to quantify the benefit to one negotiating party (the EU) in knowing the other party's (the UK) negotiating position for various values of n negotiating choices. 
In each simulation k losing negotiating choices are revealed to the EU (of n negotiating choices) in the context of a zero sum game with a 50/50 ratio of “positive” and “negative” choices to be made. 
K (number of negotiation outcomes to be revealed after the first choice) will fall in the range of 1 to 20 (or 2 to 40% of losing choices and 1 to 20 % or all n negotiating choices).
